# Warranty Claims Fraud Prediction

### Project Overview
Fraudulent warranty claims cost manufacturing companies millions. This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict whether a warranty claim is **Genuine** or **Fraudulent**.

Using a dataset of **10,000+ records**, the system identifies high-risk claims based on:
* **Service Center Location:** (e.g., detected high fraud in Center 13)
* **Call Duration:** (Short calls < 4 mins are high risk)
* **Product Type:** (AC vs TV claim patterns)

### Tech Stack
* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy
* **ML:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression), XGBoost
* **Viz:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Results
* **Accuracy:** ~92%
* **Key Insight:** Automated flagging of high-risk claims reduces manual verification time by prioritizing specific regions.
